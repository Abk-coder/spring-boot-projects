Dialog Systems in Detail

obj principal: comprendre la question de l'utilisateur et proposer une reponse

So, in a dialog sys‐
tem, the most important thing is understanding nuances from the user’s input in a
turn-by-turn way and storing them in context to generate responses.

# Dialog act or intent:  the aim of a user command.
# Slot or entity: fixed ontological construct that holds information regarding specific entities related to the intent
The slots and value together are sometimes denoted as an “entity"
# Dialog state or context: an ontological construct that contains both the information
about the dialog act as well as state-value pairs.
